I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at New York University advised by [Sam Bowman](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/). I'm interested in continuous learning, edge-assisted MLSys, and LLMs alignment. Prior to NYU, I got M.Tech and B.Tech from Purdue University and Sichuan University, respectively. I am very fortunate to collaborate closely with [Prof. Yuanchao Shu](https://yshu.org) and [Dr. Shiqi Jiang](https://chrisplus.me/) from Zhejiang University and Microsoft Research respectively. 

My recent works focus on efficiency of continuous learning systems. Specifically, I am interested in computation/memory/communication-efficiency of continuous learning systems on edge. In addition, I have an interest in computation efficiency of vision transformers in real-world deployment. 

__If you are interested in improving AIoT applications at zero/low computation/communication cost, I am open to collaboration. Please feel free to email me at jasonengineer@hotmail.com.__  

Aside from academia, I enjoy building some useful toolkits for the AI system community. Now, I have built several tools to accelerate the deployment of PyTorch models on GPU and Mobile Phones. If you find they are useful in your research, please consider star them ~~
