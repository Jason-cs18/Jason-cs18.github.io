I am Yan Lu and a Computer Science Ph.D. student at New York University advised by [Sam Bowman](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/). I'm interested in efficiency of ML algorithms and systems.

My recent works focus on (1) computation efficiency of vision transformer; (2) data efficiency of 3D point data; (3) memory-efficiency of continuous learning; (4) human-efficiency of collaborative learning or active learning.
