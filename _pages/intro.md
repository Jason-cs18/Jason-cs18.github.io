I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at New York University advised by [Sam Bowman](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/). I'm interested in efficiency of machine learning algorithms and systems (especially on continuous learning and domain adaptation). Prior to NYU, I got M.Tech and B.Tech from Purdue University and Sichuan University, respectively. I am very fortunate to collaborate closely with [Dr. Yuanchao Shu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yushu/publications/) and [Dr. Shiqi Jiang](https://chrisplus.me/) from Microsoft Research. 

My recent works focus on (1) computation efficiency of vision transformer; (2) data efficiency of 3D point data; (3) memory-efficiency of continuous learning; (4) communication-efficiency of edge continuous learning.
