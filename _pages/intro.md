I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at New York University advised by [Sam Bowman](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/). I'm interested in continuous learning, efficient edge-assisted AISys. Prior to NYU, I got M.Tech and B.Tech from Purdue University and Sichuan University, respectively. I am very fortunate to collaborate closely with [Prof. Yuanchao Shu](https://yshu.org) and [Dr. Shiqi Jiang](https://chrisplus.me/) from Zhejiang University and Microsoft Research respectively. 

My recent works focus on the efficiency of continuous learning systems. Specifically, I am interested in computation/memory/communication-efficiency of continuous learning systems on edge. In addition, I have an interest in the computation efficiency of vision transformers in a real-world deployment.
