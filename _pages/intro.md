I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at New York University advised by [Sam Bowman](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/). I'm interested in efficiency of ML algorithms and systems. Prior to NYU, I got B.Tech from Sichuan University. I am very fortunate to collaborate closely with [Dr. Yuanchao Shu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yushu/publications/) and [Dr. Shiqi Jiang](https://chrisplus.me/) from Microsoft Research. 

My recent works focus on (1) computation efficiency of vision transformer; (2) data efficiency of 3D point data; (3) memory-efficiency of continuous learning; (4) human-efficiency of collaborative learning or active learning.
